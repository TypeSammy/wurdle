# ðŸŒˆ Worlde Project

This project is for SEiFXR08-2022 and incorporates vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

## ðŸŒŸ Goal

The end goal is to separate each function into its own distinct sections, and to have variables and functions explicitly named. Students should be able to read `script.js` and hopefully find the code easy to read, navigate and understand.
